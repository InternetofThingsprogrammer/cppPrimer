Sweet little words made for silence, not talk

Young heart for love not heartache

Dark hair for catching the wind

Not to veil the sight of a cold world

Kiss

While your lips are still red

While he's still in silent.rest

While the bosom is still untouched, unveiled

Hold another hand

While the hand's still without a tool

Drown into your eyes while they're still blind

Love while the night still hides the withering dawn

sh , keep listening

First day of love never comes back

A passionate hour is never a wasted one

The violin,the poets hand
 
Every thawing heart plays your theme with care
 
Kiss

While your lips are still red

While he's still in silent.rest

While the bosom is still untouched, unveiled

Hold another hand

While the hand's still without a tool

Drown into your eyes while they're still blind

Love while the night still hides the withering dawn

Kiss

While your lips are still red

While he's still in silent.rest

While the bosom is still untouched, unveiled

Hold another hand

While the hand's still without a tool

Drown into your eyes while they're still blind

Love while the night still hides the withering dawn
