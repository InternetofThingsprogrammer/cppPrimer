Oh, nowhere left to go  
Are we getting closer? Closer?  
No, all we know is "No"  
Nights are getting colder, colder  
Hey, tears all fall the same  
We all feel the rain  
We can't change
Everywhere we go  
We're looking for the sun
Nowhere to grow old
We're always on the run
They say we'll rot in Hell
But I don't think we will
They've branded us enough
Outlaws of love.
Scars make us who we are
Hearts and homes are broken, broken
Far, we could go so far
With our minds wide open, open
Hey, tears all fall the same
We all feel the rain
We can't change
Everywhere we go
We're looking for the sun
Nowhere to grow old
We're always on the run
They say we'll rot in Hell
But I don't think we will
They've branded us enough
Outlaws of love
Everywhere we go
We're looking for the sun
Nowhere to grow old
We're always on the run
They say we'll rot in Hell
But I don't think we will
They've branded us enough
Outlaws of love
Outlaws of love
Outlaws of love
Outlaws of love
Outlaws of love
